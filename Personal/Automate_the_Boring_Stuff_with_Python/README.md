# AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON

## CHAPTER 1
Ejercicio | Descripción
----------|------------
[Ejercicio1](rectPrint.py) | Write a program that prints a rectangle of capital O characters. The program should always print a rectangle of O characters that has a height of five (that is, five rows), but the width should be based on an integer the user enters.
[Ejercicio2](perimeterAreaCalculator.py) | Write a program that accepts the width and length of a rectangular space from the user and then calculates both the perimeter and area of this space.

----------|------------
[Ejercicio1](safeTemp.py) | The following program reports whether a given temperature is safe. It asks the user to enter a temperature in two parts. First, they should enter C or F to indicate the Celsius or Fahrenheit scale; second, they should enter the number of degrees. If the temperature is between 16 and 38 degrees Celsius (inclusive of 16 and 38) or between 60.8 and 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (inclusive of 60.8 and 100.4), the program prints Safe. Outside of these temperature ranges, the program prints Dangerous. This program has bugs, however. Rewrite the code to fix the errors. You may assume the user always enters valid inputs and not, say, X for the scale or hello for the number of degrees.
[Ejercicio2](safeTempExpr.py) | It’s possible to write the safe temperature logic of the previous program in a single condition. Fill in the blank in the following program with this condition to make it work in the same way as the previous program.
[Ejercicio3](fizzBuzzNumber.py) | Fizz Buzz is a common programming challenge that goes like this. Write a program that accepts an integer from the user. If the integer is divisible by 3, the program should print Fizz. If the integer is divisible by 5, the program should print Buzz. If the integer is divisible by 3 and 5, the program should print Fizz Buzz. Otherwise, the program should print the number the user entered.

## CHAPTER 3
Ejercicio | Descripción
----------|------------
[Ejercicio1](treePrint.py) | Use a for loop to print a triangular pine tree of a size the user asks for. The tree branches should be printed as a number of rows of ^ characters, while the trunk should always be two # characters. As a second exercise, write this same program using while loops instead of for loops.
[Ejercicio2](xmasTreePrint.py) | Instead of creating a plain tree like the one in the previous project, write a program that prints a Christmas tree with o ball ornaments randomly replacing ^ branch characters. As a second exercise, write this same program using while loops instead of for loops.
